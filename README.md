# Realistic-Image-Generation

This is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10738.pdf) on which our work for Realistic Image Generation is based.
For realistic image generation we used GAN with differentiable augmentation on generator and discriminator.

Repository on which is our code based is [here](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans).

We trained GAN on CIFAR-10 dataset, Obama-100 dataset and also our work is to train GAN to [food image dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41)
